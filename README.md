### Short Description

The game was made in free time as a project for fun. I love those types of games and I'm definitely going to make more of them. It was a challenging project mainly because of optimizaiton problems for mobile devices.

### During the development I have worked on different features:

* Designing the App from the ground using Figma.
* Implementation of the App using React with Typescript.
* Simple firestore database for leaderboard.
* ~~Testing with Jest.~~
* xState for state management.
* Styling with styled-components and framer/motion.
* ~~Support for mobile devices using media-queries.~~
